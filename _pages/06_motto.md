<p>A horse is a horse<br>
of course, of course<br>
and no one can talk to horse, of course.<br>
That is, of course,<br>
unless the horse<br>
is the famous Mister Ed.<br>
<br>
Go right to the source<br>
and ask the horse,<br>
he'll give you the answer that you'll endorse;<br>
He's always on a steady course.<br>
Talk to Mister Ed!<br>
<br>
People yakkity yak a streak<br>
and waste your time o' day.<br>
But Mister Ed will never speak<br>
unless he has something to say!<br>
<br>
A horse is a horse,<br>
of course, of course<br>
and this one'll talk 'til his voice is hoarse.<br>
You never heard of a talking horse?<br>
Well listen to this,<br>
I am Mister Ed! <br>
</p>
