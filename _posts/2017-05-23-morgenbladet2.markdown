Mari Rege and Odny Solheim are still in denial.

<p>Where <a href="https://morgenbladet.no/ideer/2017/04/kunnskap-om-laerertetthet">before</a> they were claiming that we were using transitory and unpredictible variation in <a href="http://leuven.economists.nl/papers/2017/03/03/class-size.html">our study</a> to estimate class size effects, this is <a href="https://morgenbladet.no/ideer/2017/05/en-gang-til-om-norm-laerertetthet-og-forutsigbarhet">now</a> off the table.</p>

Now it is something else: schools are facing large and unpredictible changes in class sizes from cohort to cohort, and on top of it schools are unable to handle that.

At least if we have to believe Rege and Solheim, because they forget to mention that these are hypotheses (my mom would call it opinions).

They also forget to check the data. 

If we do that then we see in the period we study (1978-2003) that for the large majority of schools, class size in our data varies by at most 5 pupils from cohort to cohort.

For a given school these changes are on average zero across cohorts.

Schools therefore typically have stable class sizes with small variations around the mean.

These changes are partially predictible (in our data with past changes in enrollment) and are small.

And not unpredictible and large as claimed by Rege and Solheim.
